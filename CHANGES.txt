0.2.0:


- FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS:

 - Implemented YAML emitter, and related unittests/documentation.

 - Tags are now stored in nodes, allowing D:YAML to be closer to the 
   specification.
 
 - Loader API has been broken to make it more extensible in future - 
   Representer and Constructor are no more specified in the constructor,
   and the load() shortcut functions have been removed, as all that's needed to
   load a YAML document now is Loader("file.yaml").load() .


- BUGFIXES:
 
 - Fixed many bugs in the parser, scanner, composer and constructor.
